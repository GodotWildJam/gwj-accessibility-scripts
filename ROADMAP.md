# Road Map 

Here is a list, by category, of the desired scripts for all Godot Engine users to incorporate and enjoy. Each category is broken down into basic, intermediate, and advanced per the [Game Accessibility Guidelines](http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/full-list/) site that we use in the game jam. 

If you have a better resource, or format suggestion, please let us know. We are aware that not every use case will apply to all games.
