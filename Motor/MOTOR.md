# Motor 

## Basic ##

- [x] Allows controls be remapped/reconfigured
- [ ] [Ensure controls are as simple as possible, or provide a simpler alternative.](https://github.com/GodotWildJam/gwj-accessibility-scripts/issues/2)
- [ ] Ensure that all areas of the user interface can be accessed using the same input method as the gameplay
- [ ] Include an option to adjust the sensitive of controls
- [ ] Ensure interactive elements/virtual controls are large and well spaced
- [ ] Include toggle/slider for any haptics

## Intermediate ##

- [ ] Support more than one input device
- [ ] Make interactive elements that require accuracy (eg. cursor/touch controlled menu options) stationary
- [ ] Ensure that multiple simultaneous actions (eg. click/drag or swipe) are not required, and included only as a supplementary / alternative input method
- [ ] Ensure that all key actions can be carried out by digital controls (pad / keys / presses), with more complex input (eg. analogue, speech, gesture) not required, and included only as supplementary / alternative input methods
- [ ] Include an option to adjust the game speed
- [ ] Avoid repeated inputs (button-mashing/quick time events)
- [ ] If producing a PC game, support windowed mode for compatibility with overlaid virtual keyboards
- [ ] Avoid / provide alternatives to requiring buttons to be held down
- [ ] Allow interfaces to be rearranged
- [ ] Allow interfaces to be resized
- [ ] Provide a macro system
- [ ] Do not rely on motion tracking of specific body types

## Advanced ##

- [ ] Allow play in both portrait and landscape
- [ ] Do not make precise timing essential to gameplay â€“ offer alternatives, actions that can be carried out while paused, or a skip mechanism
- [ ] Include a cool-down period (post acceptance delay) of 0.5 seconds between inputs
- [ ] Provide very simple control schemes that are compatible with assistive technology devices, such as switch or eye tracking
